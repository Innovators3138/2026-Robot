### Branch Policy ###
 - When I start a feature, I will create a branch off of main. 
 - When I have completed my changes, I will submit a pull request to main.
 - I will have good comments, and good commit messages.
 - One other teammate must review my changes before committing to main.
 - All code should follow team guidelines.

### Tournament Coding Policy ###
 - Before each tournament, we will create a branch off of main that has a stable version of robot code.
 - Any changes to the robot code for the tournament will be pushed directly to that branch, bypassing PR requirements.
